# Weather-App
 A weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript delivers real-time weather details like temperature, humidity, and forecasts. HTML structures the content, CSS styles the layout, and JavaScript fetches and updates the weather data from an API. Users can easily access accurate weather information for their location or any specified location, aiding in planning their daily activities.
